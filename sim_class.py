        into build_input_sequence-style assembly, or to resume stepping.

        Caveats
        -------
        - R history isn't saved (save_h5 only stores S_hist/I_hist), so R is
        reconstructed as zeros. That's correct for the current SI-only setup
        (gamma forced to 0 in randomBG), but would be wrong if you ever run
        a true SIR simulation with recovery — you'd need to add R_hist to
        save_h5/load_h5 first.
        - The dispersal kernel isn't saved either. If you want to resume
        stepping this sim (not just read its history), call createMatrix()
        or randomMatrix() again before calling step() — otherwise self.kernel
        won't exist and _single_step will fail.

        Binomial thinning is statistically equivalent to applying the false
